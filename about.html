		<p>What is Bubble Tea?</p>
		</div>
		<div class="about-text">
		<img src="coffeecup.jpg" />
		<p>BUBBLE Tea refers to the layer of foamy bubbles that appear after the tea is vigorously shaken. Now, "bubble tea" may be (mis)used to refer to any drink (even if it's not tea) that contains chewy tapioca balls. These fun, chewy munchies are sipped up with a jumbo straw. The tapioca balls are also known as "boba" or "pearls". That is why some people call the drink Boba Tea or Pearl Tea.</p><br /> 

		<p>This beverage was first introduced in the 1980's by a Taiwanese street vendor who created drinks to sell to school children. In just a few years, word quickly spread throughout Asia about this strange concoction of flavored tea, milk, and chewy tapioca balls. In the late 1990's, the beverage went overseas and gained widespread popularity.</p><br />

		<p>Although tapioca goes great with bubble tea, it is an acquired taste. JELLY and POPPING BOBA are other alternatives for those who prefer a different texture.</p><br />

		<p>JELLY is an agar snack that has the consistency of a hard Jello. POPPING BOBA are pearl-size capsules that, once bitten, will release an invigorating "pop" of fruit juice inside your mouth--similar to the candy Gushers. JELLY and POPPING BOBA also come in different flavors.</p>
